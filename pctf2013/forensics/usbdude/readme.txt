I broke a USB cable while making this problem... you better enjoy it.
usbdude.pcap.
HINT: I would suggest static reversing from the entry point, or alternatively there appears to be a relevant string to google.
Hint: If you think r29 stays constant, then you're probably using IDA which emits slightly confusing disassembly.
