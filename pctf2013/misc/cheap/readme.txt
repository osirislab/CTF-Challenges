What could this mysterious architecture be?
All of these are the same:
50.17.171.79:9998
54.224.183.192:9998
184.73.107.54:9998
54.234.231.14:9998
54.224.176.148:9998
Note:Apparently GNU netcat doesn't support a half-duplex shutdown, so you should use OpenBSD netcat or connect using python or something for cheap.
The flag is not an architecture.
